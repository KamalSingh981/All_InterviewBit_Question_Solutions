**Problem Description**

Given two integer arrays **A** and **B** of size **N** each which represent **values** and **weights** associated with **N** items respectively.

Also given an integer **C** which represents knapsack capacity.

Find out the maximum value subset of **A** such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to **C**.

**NOTE:**

- You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

**Problem Constraints**

1 <= N <= 103

1 <= C <= 103

1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 103

**Input Format**

First argument is an integer array **A** of size **N** denoting the values on **N** items.

Second argument is an integer array **B** of size **N** denoting the weights on **N** items.

Third argument is an integer **C** denoting the knapsack capacity.

**Output Format**

Return a single integer denoting the maximum value subset of **A** such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to **C**.

**Example Input**

Input 1:

```
 A = [60, 100, 120]
 B = [10, 20, 30]
 C = 50

```

Input 2:

```
 A = [10, 20, 30, 40]
 B = [12, 13, 15, 19]
 C = 10

```

**Example Output**

Output 1:

```
 220

```

Output 2:

```
 0

```

**Example Explanation**

Explanation 1:

```
 Taking items with weight 20 and 30 will give us the maximum value i.e 100 + 120 = 220

```

Explanation 2:

```
 Knapsack capacity is 10 but each item has weight greater than 10 so no items can be considered in the knapsack therefore answer is 0.

```

```cpp
int Solution::solve(vector<int> &A, vector<int> &B, int C) {
    
    int n = A.size();
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n+1, vector<int>(C+1, 0));
    
    
    for(int i = 1; i<=n; i++){
        for(int j = 1; j<=C; j++){
            if(B[i - 1] <= j){
                dp[i][j] = max(A[i-1] + dp[i-1][j-B[i-1]], dp[i-1][j]);
            }
            else{
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j];
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[n][C];
}
```
