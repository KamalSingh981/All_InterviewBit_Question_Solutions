**Problem Description**

Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors.

**Note:** The test cases are generated in the following format (use the following format to use **See Expected Output** option):
 First integer N is the number of nodes.
 Then, N intgers follow denoting the label (or hash) of the N nodes.
 Then, N2 integers following denoting the adjacency matrix of a graph, where **Adj[i][j] = 1** denotes presence of an undirected edge between the ith and jth node, **O** otherwise.

**Problem Constraints**

**Input Format**

First and only argument is a node A denoting the root of the undirected graph.

**Output Format**

Return the node denoting the root of the new clone graph.

**Example Input**

Input 1:

```
      1
    / | \
   3  2  4
        / \
       5   6
```

Input 2:

```
      1
     / \
    3   4
   /   /|\
  2   5 7 6
```

**Example Output**

Output 1:

```
 Output will the same graph but with new pointers:
      1
    / | \
   3  2  4
        / \
       5   6
```

Output 2:

```
      1
     / \
    3   4
   /   /|\
  2   5 7 6
```

**Example Explanation**

Explanation 1:

```
 We need to return the same graph, but the pointers to the node should be different.
```
