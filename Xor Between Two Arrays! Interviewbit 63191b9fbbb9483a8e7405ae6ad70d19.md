1 <= |A|, |B| <= 105

1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 109

**Input Format**

First argument is an integer array **A**.

Second argument is an integer array **B**.

**Output Format**

Return an integer denoting the maximum xor value as described in the question.

**Example Input**

Input 1:

```
 A = [1, 2, 3]
 B = [4, 1, 2]

```

**Example Output**

**Example Explanation**
