Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

**Example :**

Given the below binary tree and `sum = 22`,

```
              5
             / \
            4   8
           /   / \
          11  13  4
         /  \      \
        7    2      1

```

return `true`, as there exist a root-to-leaf path `5->4->11->2` which sum is `22`.

**Return `0 / 1` ( 0 for false, 1 for true ) for this problem**

Note:You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified. Still have a question? Checkout [Sample Codes](https://www.interviewbit.com/pages/sample_codes/) for more details.
