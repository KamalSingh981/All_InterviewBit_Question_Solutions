Two kingdoms are on a war right now, kingdom X and kingdom Y. As a war specialist of kingdom X, you scouted kingdom Y area.

A kingdom area is defined as a **N x M grid** with each cell denoting a village.
 Each cell has a value which denotes the strength of each corresponding village.
 The strength can also be **negative**, representing those warriors of your kingdom who were held hostages.

Thereâ€™s also another thing to be noticed.

- The strength of any village on row larger than one (2<=r<=N) is stronger or equal to the strength of village which is exactly above it.
- The strength of any village on column larger than one (2<=c<=M) is stronger or equal to the strength of vilage which is exactly to its left. (stronger means having higher value as defined above).

So your task is, find the **largest sum of strength** that you can erase by bombing **one sub-matrix** in the grid.

**Input format:**

```
First line consists of 2 integers N and M denoting the number of rows and columns in the grid respectively.
The next N lines, consists of M integers each denoting the strength of each cell.

1 <= N <= 1500
1 <= M <= 1500
-200 <= Cell Strength <= 200

```

Output:

```
The largest sum of strength that you can get by choosing one sub-matrix.

```

**Example:**

```
Input:
3 3
-5 -4 -1
-3 2 4
2 5 8

Output:
19

Explanation:
Bomb the sub-matrix from (2,2) to (3,3): 2 + 4 + 5 + 8 = 19

```

```cpp
int Solution::solve(vector<vector<int> > &A) {
    
    int n = A.size(); 
    int m = A[0].size();
    
    int ans = INT_MIN;
    
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n+1, vector<int>(m+1, 0));
    dp[n-1][m-1] = A[n-1][m-1];
    
    for(int i = n-1; i>=0; i--){
        for(int j = m-1; j>=0; j--){
            dp[i][j] = A[i][j] + dp[i+1][j] + dp[i][j+1] - dp[i+1][j+1];
            ans = max(ans, dp[i][j]);
            
        }
    }
    return ans; 
}
```
