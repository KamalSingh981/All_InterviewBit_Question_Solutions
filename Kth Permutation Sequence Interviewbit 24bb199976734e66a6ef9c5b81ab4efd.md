The set `[1,2,3,â€¦,n]` contains a total of `n!` unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,
 We get the following sequence (ie, for `n = 3` ) :

```
1. "123"
2. "132"
3. "213"
4. "231"
5. "312"
6. "321"

```

Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

For example, given `n = 3, k = 4, ans = "231"`

Note:You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified. Still have a question? Checkout [Sample Codes](https://www.interviewbit.com/pages/sample_codes/) for more details.

```cpp
void ans(int n, int k, string &anst, vector<int> &arr, vector<int> &fact){
    if(n == 0) return;
    
    int f = fact[n-1];
    int  idx= k/f;
    if(k%f == 0){
        idx--;
    }
    anst += to_string(arr[idx]);
    arr.erase(arr.begin()+idx);
    k -= f*idx;
    ans(n-1, k, anst, arr, fact);
}

string Solution::getPermutation(int A, int B) {
    vector<int> s, fact(A+1, 1);
    for(int i = 1; i<=A; i++){
        s.push_back(i);
        if(i>12) fact[i] = INT_MAX;
        else fact[i] = i*fact[i-1];
        
    }
    
    string res = "";
    ans(A, B, res, s, fact);
    return res;
}
